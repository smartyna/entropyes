# entropyes
entropyes repository provides a peak into essential entropy toolset building, for neural data visualisation in the context of randomness/predictability.

The toolkit, so far, contains a few processing pipelines needed to visualise the sampling bias regularisation output for neural units entropy(different bias-reduction approaches), raw and Poisson-regularised entropy in the context of firing rate and variance, essential spike train statistics, and mutual information computation between different extracellular and ground-truth (patch-clamp or juxtacellular) neural recordings. 

The toolkit in its current state helps in the information-theoretic analysis of the neural data in the context of neural decomposition quality/characteristics of various spike sorting algorithms.

Next developments will be focusing on estimating individual neural units' quality for specific sorters.

entropyes is to be integrated within the spikeforest framework (Flatiron Institute, https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest2).
